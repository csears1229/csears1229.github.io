## Welcome to My ePortfolio

I have created this portfolio to showcase some of my best projects that I have created as I work to complete my Computer Science degree at Southern New Hampshire University. These projects will highlight my skills in the following areas: 
- Software Design and Engineering
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Databases
Along with the projects I have also included a video of me doing a Code Review. The Code Review was recorded before I began my work on these projects and explained the changes that I wanted to make.  

### About Me

My name is Carson Sears and I currently work as a System Administrator for the Utah Army National Guard. In 2011 I was a student at Utah State University studying to complete a degree in Mechanical Engineering. As part of my coursework I was required to take an Intro to Computer Science course teaching the basics of C++. Over the semester I fell in love with software development and was excited to create things in C++. After that course I changed my degree to Computer Science and have done all I can to learn about the exciting world of software development. 

I have been a student at Southern New Hampshire University for the last 3 years. During my time at SNHU I was able to continue to improve my skills as a Software Developer and Engineer. I have worked with C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MySQL, and MongoDB. I have also taken courses on the Agile Software Development Life Cycle, Database Design, Git Collaboration, Software Testing Automation, Computer Graphics using OpenGL and C++, and many more courses that I feel make me a well-rounded Software Developer.
