This is the "Behind the Scenes" look at my portfolio. I used the GitHub documentation to make my portfolio shine. 
There isn't much to see here, but check out my [portfolio](https://csears1229.github.io/) here to get some info about
[me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carson-sears) and the [projects](https://github.com/csears1229?tab=repositories) that i'm working on.
